# Firebase Authentication Demo

Once logged in, the user can press the logout button to start over.

## Code
The functions for the sign in and sign up menus can be found in [signin.dart](lib/signin.dart) and [signup.dart](lib/signup.dart). The logout button code can be found in [homepage.dart](lib/homepage.dart).
